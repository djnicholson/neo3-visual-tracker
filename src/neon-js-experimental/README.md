# Pre-release neon-js code

The code in this folder is taken from the neon-js/packages/neon-js/src/experimental folder
in the next branch (433f8cc) of git@github.com:CityOfZion/neon-js.git. It has had minimal
changes made so that it compiles in the context of this code base.

This allows us to deploy and invoke smart contracts on Neo 3 TestNet before @CityOfZion
have released a version of neon-js that officially supports this.

TODO: Remove this entire folder and consume an official neon-js release that supports
Neo 3.
